Hello Worlders,

Here is a Todo activity list, still a work in progress but still also ready for production.
Creating a simple To-Do list that also allows you to delete tasks when completed and new features would be added soon that would allow you to add timestamps to when the tasks were created and the time when the task is expected to be completed.
That means I still have a lot to do, Back to business.

Happy Coding.
